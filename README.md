# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project presents a deep learning–based plant disease detection system designed to classify plant leaf images into 38 disease and healthy categories. The goal is to support early identification of crop diseases, helping farmers and agricultural professionals reduce losses and improve productivity.

🌱 Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning–based plant disease detection system that classifies plant leaf images into 38 disease and healthy categories. It aims to help farmers and agricultural professionals identify crop diseases early, improving yield and reducing losses.

The model is trained on the New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented) from Kaggle, containing 87,000+ labeled images across multiple plant species.
